        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This easy overnight oats with chia seeds recipe is naturally sweetened with peaches, but any chopped fresh or frozen fruit works well here. Chia seeds thicken the mixture as it sits, and they offer a healthy dose of fiber and omega-3 fats. Store these oats in individual airtight containers (like a mason jar) for an easy breakfast on the go.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 and 1/3 cups unsweetened plain almond milk</li>
            <li>1 cup old-fashioned rolled oats</li>
            <li>1/4 cup low-fat plain strained yogurt (such as Greek-style)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chia seeds</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup chopped peaches, thawed if frozen, divided</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped pecans plus 2 tablespoons, divided</li>
            <li>Pure maple syrup for serving (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine almond milk, oats, yogurt, chia seeds, cinnamon, salt, 1/2 cup peaches and 1/4 cup pecans in a medium bowl; stir to mix well. Cover and refrigerate until the oats have absorbed the liquid and the mixture has thickened, at least 8 hours or up to 5 days.</li>
            <li>Divide the oats between 2 bowls. Top each bowl with 2 tablespoons peaches and 1 tablespoon pecans. Drizzle with maple syrup, if desired.</li>       
        </ol>
